Notes
=====

This section was pretty brief. Mainly covered basic pylint
operation and some comment's on documentation that I'll try
to incorporate into my work. Mentioned Restructured Text and
PEP-8 that the python community is using.


Projects
--------

I did three main project for this part, funny_name
generator, pig_latin, and poor_for_bar_chart.

For poor_for_bar_chart we needed a special version of
googletrans: ``pip3 install googletrans==3.1.0a0``
