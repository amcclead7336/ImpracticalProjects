Notes
=====

Not a bad chapter but alittle light on the new information.
I did have trouble understanding the logic behind the Palingrams but
I did find  the cProfile module interesting. I will use it in the future.
I will have to review my past scripts for where I can swap a list for a set.
The performance optimization would be helpful.


Projects
--------

The two main projects this chapter where palingrams and load_dictionary.py
